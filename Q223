223. Rectangle Area
Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.

Rectangle Area

Example:

Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
Output: 45


class Solution {
public:
    int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
        //calculate the overlapp area
        int left = max(A,E), right = min(C,G), top=min(D,H), bottom=max(B,F);
        
        //note note note:  you can not use w=max(right-left,0) as it can overflow
        int w=0, h=0;
        if (left<right) w=right-left;
        if (bottom<top) h=top-bottom;
        
        return ((C-A)*(D-B) + (G-E)*(H-F) - w*h);
    }
};
